# Test created by Dmytro Chymyrys for ILABS based on Slim Framework 3 Skeleton 

Project developed under XAMPP environment using PHP 7 version.

## Install the Application

To install this application you will need to put the root folder to htdocs folder . Database is MySQL, so for database connection you need to open  src folder and find settings.php, in this file there is DB array for db connection.  

In the root directory there is DB dumb for exporting it into database.

After that you can start testing the application on your local server.

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.



That's it! Now go build something cool.
